#Introduction
Resumes are an essential part of landing a job, but there are so many different rules, formats and writing tips that are out there how can anyone keep track of all of that. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if an online system existed that could take care of all of that and that could provide help every step of the way in the resume creation process? A free service that is dedicated to making resumes look their absolute best and then to be able to publish it to top businesses and employers? Then perhaps there could be a quick and efficient way to sort through those resumes quickly too for Employers. Well we are here to help - Welcome to the Resumizer Pro.

The Resumizer Pro system will take on the challenge of assisting job seekers in the creation of a proper resume. Resumizer Pro will primarily handle the resume creation process from the selection of the template to the possible download of the final format. The system will also concern itself with being able to organize resumes so that employers interested in hiring job seekers may review them. Although Resumizer Pro does create an environment for employers to connect with job seekers, the system will not be a place for the employer and the job seeker to interact. The system is designed to allow the initial connection, but if an employer is interested in a job seeker, they must communicate with them using other means. The system will also allow peer critiques of the posted resumes, and a numerical scoring system. 

In this user guide, Section B will familiarize you with the necessary hardware and software requirements for the Resumizer Pro. In Section C, you will learn how to log into the system and how to get started using the Resumizer Pro. Finally, section D will discuss two use cases critical to the foundation of the system. Throughout this document, we will walk you through our system gradually so that you can familiarize yourself with our system and utilize the Resumizer Pro to land the job of your dreams!
